Bluetooth Car Project

The Bluetooth Car is essentially a Particle Argon microcontroller attached to a toy car chassis with two DC motors. 
This code was written to translate the accelerometer coordinates of my phone into a direction and speed for the car.
To connect my phone to the Particle Argon, I used BluefruitConnect.
